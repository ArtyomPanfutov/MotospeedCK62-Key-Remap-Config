# Key Remap for the keyboard Motospeed CK62

When I bought this keyboard I wasn't happy about its layer switching implementation, so I decided to make my own key binding.

I use this keyboard on Mac and Windows and unfortunately, I haven't found a single cross-platform application for both platforms. Thus, I use two different applications for each platform to add my own key mappings:
* for Windows - AutoHotKey
* for Mac - Karabiner

When I was creating these mappings I tried to copy Vim shortcuts(at least to achieve similarity) that's why arrow keys for example mapped to hjkl.

I'm trying to keep mappings in sync for both applications but thery are might be a bit different.
